# Auth Hackathon

Today you can build whatever you like! The only requirement is that a user must have to log in to use it.

Today we will be using 3rd party services to manage our users, and integrating them with our apps. This means that we wont have to handle password hashing on our server.

## Auth options

**Auth0**

[Auth0](https://auth0.com/) is a service that will allow you to have users sign into your project. The docs are good and [this tutorial](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react) will help you integrate it with react.

**Firebase**

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) can also serve as a drop in auth solution and can also provide many other services. A little more thought will be required for you to integrate it into react. [This will tell you about how to use it on your page](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup). You will have to search for the Auth sections. Do not go down the cli route for today...

Happy hacking!
